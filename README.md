🌸 KalaKriti AI: An AI-Powered Global Marketplace for Artisans

✨ Empowering Tradition Through Technology

KalaKriti AI is a groundbreaking global marketplace designed to revitalize traditional Indian craftsmanship by merging cultural authenticity with advanced AI tools. Our mission is to empower local artisans to secure a sustainable future by giving them global visibility and the ability to co-create unique, personalized art with customers.

🎯 The Core Innovation: AI as Collaborator

Our platform is defined by its unique approach: AI acts as a partner, not a replacement. This philosophy is demonstrated through our two flagship features, all built using Google Cloud AI tools:

1. Custom AI Co-Creation Engine (The USP)

Function: Allows the customer to input a product idea and select an artistic style (Traditional, Fusion, etc.).

Process: Vertex AI (Imagen/Gemini) instantly generates a precise visual Mockup Preview .

Value: Bridges the gap between customer vision and artisan capability, creating a high-value, customizable order pipeline.

2. AI Guardian of Tradition 🛡️

Function: A critical, real-time compliance filter that runs on every customer request.

Process: Instantly classifies requests as PASS or FAIL, intervening to block submissions that involve copyright infringement or cultural trivialization (e.g., misuse of sacred imagery).

Value: Upholds the integrity of traditional art and ensures the platform remains a safe, respectful environment.
